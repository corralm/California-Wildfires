# Predicting How Many Acres Will Burn in a California Wildfire

## Problem Statement
For the past 7 years (2013-2019), an average of 900k acres burn every year due to wildfires in California [[source]](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/). That's about the size of the San Franciso Bay Area! Furthermore, AccuWeather estimated the total damage and economic loss caused by wildfires cost California \\$400 billion in 2018 and \\$85 billion in 2017 [[source]](https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/california-wildfires-will-cost-tens-of-billions-accuweather-estimates/612548).  

The goal of this project is to predict the amount of acres burned given a California wildfire, using linear regression.
